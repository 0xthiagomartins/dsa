# Data Structures & Algorithms Collection

Personal collection of algorithms and data structures implementations for learning and practice across multiple programming languages.

## Project Structure

Each algorithm/data structure has its own directory with implementations in different languages:

```
dsa/
├── search/
│   ├── Main.java
│   ├── main.py
│   ├── main.js
│   └── README.md
├── sorting/
│   ├── Main.java
│   ├── main.py
│   ├── main.js
│   └── README.md
└── ...
```

## Implemented Algorithms

### Search
- [x] **Search** - Multiple search algorithms comparison
  - Linear Search: O(n) time, O(1) space
  - Binary Search: O(log n) time, O(1) space (iterative)
  - Implementations: Java, Python, JavaScript

### Sorting
- [ ] **Sorting** - Multiple sorting algorithms comparison
  - Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort

### Data Structures
- [ ] Dynamic Array
- [ ] Linked List
- [ ] Stack
- [ ] Queue
- [ ] Hash Table
- [ ] Binary Tree
- [ ] Heap

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the desired algorithm directory
2. Choose your programming language
3. Run the code following the instructions in the specific README

## Languages Used

- [x] Java
- [x] Python
- [x] JavaScript
- [ ] Rust

- [ ] C#

## Learning Approach

This collection serves as a personal learning tool. When studying a new programming language:
1. Pick an algorithm you want to practice
2. Study the pseudocode and complexity analysis in the README
3. Implement it in your target language
4. Add the implementation to the algorithm's directory
